Generate Violin Plots in SAS

## Abstract
If you've ever seen a box-and-whisker plot you were probably unimpressed.  It lives up to its name, providing a basic visualization of the distribution of an outcome: the interquartile range (the box), the minimum and maximum (the whiskers), the median, and maybe a few outliers if you’re (un)lucky.  Enter the violin plot.  This data visualization technique harnesses density estimates to describe the outcome’s distribution.  In layman's terms the violin plot widens around larger clusters (the upper and lower bouts of a violin) of values and narrows around smaller clusters (the 'waist' of the violin), delivering a nuanced visualization of an outcome.  With the power of SAS/GRAPH®, the savvy SAS® programmer can not only reproduce the statistics the box-and-whiskers plot produces but augment them.  This paper covers various SAS techniques required to produce violin plots.
